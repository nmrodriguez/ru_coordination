# Changes from last semester

B. FINANCES - The Department of Spanish and Portuguese is committed to supporting students in financial need, including helping with technology and textbook requirements. Students do not need to navigate financial challenges alone. If you encounter financial challenges related to this class, please let the instructor know ASAP so that the department can work with you and your instructor to make the necessary arrangements.
